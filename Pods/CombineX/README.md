CombineX is an open source implementation for Apple's [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine). It allows you to get rid of platform and version restrictions, and use Combine's API now.

## Notice

This library is still in beta, so **do not use it in production!**

üê±

## Status

Compatible with Combine beta 6.

## What is Combine

Combine is a responsive framework published by Apple at WWDC 2019, which refers to the interface design of [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/) and provides Apple's preferred implementation for Swift asynchronous programming. It will definitely be the cornerstone of Swift programming in the foreseeable future.

## What is CombineX

CombineX is an open source implementation of Combine. In addition to having an API and behavior consistent with Combine, it has the following advantages:

### 1. Versions and Platforms

`Combine` has very high version restrictions: macOS 10.15+, iOS 13+. In other words, even if your app only needs to be compatible with two versions forward, it will take two to three years before you can use it. `Combine` is exclusive to the Apple platform and does not support Linux.

`CombineX` helps you get rid of these limitations, it supports macOS 10.12+, iOS 10+, and supports Linux. With `CombineX`, you can use the same code on more platforms and versions.

### 2. Open source

'Combine' is closed source, it is like 'UIKit', 'MapKit', etc., updated with the update of Xcode. When you encounter a bug, "you should have encountered a system library bug," debugging is very annoying, but more annoying is the slow official response, usually, you can't do anything but wait for the next regular update of Xcode.

### 3. Extensions

`CombineX` provides a number of related extensions, including but not limited to:

- [CombineX.Foundation](https://github.com/luoxiu/CombineX.Foundation): provides all `Foundation` extension implementations, built on top of `CombineX`. For example, `URLSession`, `NotificationCenter`, `Timer`, `DispatchQueue+Scheduler`, `RunLoop+Scheduler`, etc.
- [CombineX.Cocoa](https://github.com/luoxiu/CombineX.Cocoa): provides `Cocoa` extension implementations, built on top of `CombineX`. For example, `KVOPublisher`, `MethodInterceptionPublisher`, `UIKit+CX`, etc.
- [CombineX.Compatible](https://github.com/CombineXCommunity/CombineX.Compatible): provides API Shims for `CombineX` to help you resolve migration concerns that may arise. With this library, you can easily switch the underlying library from `CombineX` to `Combine` at any time.

## Install

### Swift Package Manager

```swift
dependencies.append(
    .package(url: "https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX", .branch("master"))
)
```

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'CombineX', :git => 'https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX.git', :branch => 'master'
```

### Carthage

```carthage
github "cx-org/CombineX" "master"
```

## Contribute

**Welcome! CombineX really need collaborators!!!**

Now, what `CombineX` need most are testing. You can:

1. Add more functional tests.
2. Make sure `Combine` can pass it.
3. If `CombineX` can not pass it, then you have found a `CombineX` bug, you can open an issue, or fix it directly!

### Flow

Since some people may not have macOS 10.15 beta installed, the recommended contributing way is:

1. Fork the project.
2. Open `Specs/Specs.xcworkspace`, make your changes under `CombineX/CombineX` folder.
3. All tests go `CombineXTests/CombineXTests` folder. Make sure both scheme `Specs` and scheme `CombineX` pass the tests you wrote.

## Bugs in Combine

Since `Combine` is still in beta, it is inevitable that it has bugs. If you find something strange, open an issue and discuss it with us!
