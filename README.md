## What is CXCocoa

Like ReactiveCocoa and ReaciveSwift, RxCocoa and RxSwift, CXCocoa is a derivative of [CombineX](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX). It provides [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) extensions to Cocoa Framework, making it easier to write Cocoa-related asynchronous code.

It includes but is not limited toÔºö

- MethodPublisher/DeallocatePublisher, intercepting method calls with method swizzle
- KVOPublisher, observing property changes through the KVO mechanism
- DelegateProxy, forwarding delegate message
- UIKit extensions(binder & property), subscribing control event and binding values
- UIScheduler
- ...

You can freely switch the underlying dependency between `CombineX` and `Combine`.

## Install

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'CXCocoa', :git => 'https://github.com/cx-org/CXCocoa.git', :branch => 'master'
```

### Carthage

```carthage
github "cx-org/CXCocoa" "master"
```

## What is Combine/CombineX

Check [here](https://github.com/cx-org/CombineX#what-is-combine).

## Contribution

Welcome! Any kind of contribution is welcome at any time!!!

You can:

1. Add more control extensions, especially for macOS controls.
2. Add documentation.
3. Make your suggestions.
4. Star! Then tell your friends!

**Because the upstream CombineX is still in beta, if you encounter a strange problem in this library - then it may drift from upstream. ü§£**

## Use with Combine

You can change the underlying dependency to `Combine` by passing `USE_COMBINE` to the target's build configurations. For example, if you are using CocoaPods, you can modify your podfile like below:

```ruby
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        if target.name == 'CXExtensions'
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                config.build_settings['OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS'] = '-DUSE_COMBINE'
            end
        end
    end
end
```

If you are using Carthage, you should be able to use `XCODE_XCCONFIG_FILE` to do that.

## Acknowledgement

The implementation of the library references both [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), especially ReactiveCocoa, the ObjC part is almost completely modified from its source code, really appreciate to their great work!
